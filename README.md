# Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

My motivation is to help myself and others to have a guide to study and refer to throughout the boot camp journey.  I built this project as another resource to help me and others be successful through boot camp, and to one day look back on this to see how far we have come in our journey.  It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
